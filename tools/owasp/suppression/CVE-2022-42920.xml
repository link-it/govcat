     file name: xalan-2.7.3.jar (and shaded BCEL inside)
     CVE-2022-42920 is for Apache Commons BCEL, not for Xalan.
     This is a false positive due to Xalan including a shaded copy of BCEL.
     Xalan 2.7.3 is not affected by this vulnerability which is specific to Commons BCEL 6.8.0 and earlier.
     The shaded BCEL version in Xalan is for internal use only and the vulnerability does not apply.
